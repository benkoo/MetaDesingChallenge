# The Meta Design Challenge: Project Zero
## Empowering Distributed Communities through Data Literacy


## Background
I woke up today(January 1st, 2021), realizing that the most essential and immediate proposition is to create an institution that uniquely demonstrates the intellectual insights of Indonesian, which could be a Data-Driven/Scale-Free field of science, that cut across the domains of Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Information Composition, which can be called: EconoPhysics.

Then, we can invite some of the most famous scientists that Pak Luhut mentioned yesterday, while I can go to China and other mystical places in the world, including Israel to identify the instrumental people and sources of technology that enable a cross-disciplinary data-intensive learning infrastructure, that will equip all learning and research institutions around Indonesia and around the world.

## Goal
Therefore, the proposal must include a critical component, that is a domain independent data container, that has a standard shaping economical design, so that every institution and even families can self-operate, less than $USD500, like a game console, but a data center in nature for individual and small organizations.

## Success Criteria
At the same time, the same architecture, using Docker/Kubernetes technologies, can link up many instances of such infrastructure, to community-wide, nation-wide, and world-wide distributed data centers of the same architectural design that utilizes high-bandwidth, particularly spatial/mobile network, such as 5G and Low Cost Satellite by StarLink. Since Luhut knows Elon Musk, he can offer to have Indonesia to be the first nation in the Souther Hemisphere to test run StarLink for Elon Musk. This is only $USD100 per 100Mbps, an ideal data link instrumentation that is already deployed in the north america.

## Functional Components/Outputs

I can then, go to a number of major places to identify a small scale manufacturing node, that enables Semi-Conductor and Nano-scale technologies, such as micro-scope and miniaturized manufacturing and portable/strategic data instrumentations to be embedded in devices, biological hosts, and plantations/ecological sites. This nano-scale lab model, will retarget existing, bust advanced Semi-Conductor manufacturing technologies, to support the investigation of Medical, and specifically Marine Biological, and Agricultural sciences to be deployed in campuses around Indonesia.

A technology deployment roadmap will be developed to provide the infusion of cost-effective, yet functionally focused Talent, Technology, and Data Supply Chain solutions to all distributed agencies in the above mentioned campus-based departmental institutions, some of which will be located in strategic areas around the world, particularly in Silicon valley, Arizona, Eindhoven Netherland, Haifa Israel, and one more unnamed location.

This roadmap, and the dynamically generated solution Supply Chain, will be the focus on an ongoing technology retargeting MARATHON, that continuously evolve and produce new plans in online and offline workshops that we will start running on January 2021, sponsored by Pak Luhut, who also will be the main spokes person, that represents a merger in not only technology hacking, but a form of Spiritual, Social, and Technological Integration being continuously supported by a Digital Publishing Workflow that reaches to all hackerspaces around the world. In this scheme, Indonesia can place itself in the driver seat in help driving a new form of globally beneficial, yet locally relevant civilization that can cope with all kinds of global and domestic challenges in a coherent knowledge supply chain.

## Proposed Activity
The immediate participants would include teams and individuals who are willing to conduct work in the following three stages:
1. Constitutional Framing: Writing the rules of engagement/participation, where all teams and individuals can follow and share data assets to re-imagine the global supply chain. The outcome of this stage will be a operational instruction to define the Constitutional Rules of Engagement (CRE). This stage of the development will start immediately, starting in December, 2020. The primary working platform will be a Github project, and will be written in the format of Markdown(MD) language. So that all participants of this exercise will be using an Open-ID authenticated on GitHub.
1. Project Proposals: Based on the above mentioned Constitutional Rules of Engagement (CRE), the project invite anyone around the world to submit proposals, and start sharing project proposals to invite Talents, Technology Integrators, and Territorially dependent resource contributors to endorse the proposals. This stage is simply a proposal invitation and review process, and all proposals will be shared amongst the participants based on CREâ€™s entry and exit rules.
1. Project Execution on progress monitoring: Project proposals that are admitted by the Design Challenge Committee(DCC) will receive a package of integrated resources to execute the project. This data set will be organized using online Project Management tools, ideally based on Open Source software libraries, so that the data assets can be made as transparent as possible. More importantly, all projects will be tracked using some common project management data format, so that its execution effectiveness can be measured accordingly.

## Process and Proposed Activities

I have access to two of the former CTO of Airbus, who are focused on creating Technology Roadmaps. They are using an Open Source Technology to create the Road Map, called XLP Digital Publishing Workflow System.

## Required Resources and Inputs
It is based on Docker and Kubernetes infrastructure.
