# MetaNameSpace Management Project

Meta Name Space is a Wiki Content authoring project, which talks about the principle of project-based resource management in the era of Cloud Computing and Big Data.

## NameSpace Management Practice

A significant amount of name space management technique will leverage literature and ideas originally developed in the Microservices industry, such as Containerized Technologies, Kubernetes and Service Mesh.

## Data presentation format

All the data content will be indexed and referenced using Mediawiki as a common data service platform, running on Kubernetes, so that anyone who wants to have a copy of this MetaNameSpace working content can download and run one instance on their personal data center.

## Root Name Space 
The content in MetaNameSpace is to provide a Kubernetes-based conceptual root for creating other locally useful namespaces for the user or user community. The project will create a Kubernetes compatible MediaWiki service that serves as the writable document service which starts with MetaNameSpace's intial content. This written content will be contiuously updated and shared to all participants, so that everyone can learn to operate and understand the features and working principles of Computationally supported knowledge management.
