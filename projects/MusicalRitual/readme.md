Ad #A
Communication is not talking at someone; it is “making common” something between you both. If that hasn’t happened, you may have spoken but you haven’t yet communicated.

Ad #C
Learning is more than the acquisition of the ability to think; it is the acquisition of many specialized abilities for thinking about a variety of things
